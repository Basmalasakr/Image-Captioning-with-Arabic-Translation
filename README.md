 Image Captioning & Arabic Translation System 
  Project Overview
An end-to-end AI pipeline that generates descriptive English captions for images and translates them into Arabic. This project demonstrates the integration of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
 My Specific Contribution
In this team project, I was responsible for the **Machine Translation Module**:
 Developed a Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model to translate generated captions from English to Arabic.
 Handled text preprocessing, tokenization, and padding for bilingual datasets.
 Tech Stack
* **Image Features:** VGG/ResNet (CNN).
* **Captioning:** Transformer & LSTM.
* **Translation:** Seq2Seq Model.
* **Interface:** Gradio/GUI for user interaction.
